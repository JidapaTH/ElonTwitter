Physics is the law.\\nNormal\\nYes\\nDetailed specs & pricing will be provided, as well as test rides in Y\\nModel Y, being an SUV, is about 10% bigger than Model 3, so will cost about 10% more & have slightly less range for same battery\\nModel Y unveil event on March 14 at LA Design Studio\\nFirst public Tesla V3.0 Supercharger Station goes live Wed 8pm\\nСпасибо за добрые слова!\\nSpaceX team in Hawthorne control, Dragon docked to Station above pic.twitter.com/JUWkOrWjsH\\nSpaceX Crew Dragon has docked with International @Space_Station pic.twitter.com/CccsItLLvJ\\nYes, she would be able to breathe\\nProximity docking sequence underway. Dragon shadow visible on on @Space_Station solar arrays. pic.twitter.com/ELsxgLIvf0\\nOne day we will be there to see for ourselves https:// m.youtube.com/watch?v=GbXION SjmkY …\\n69F\\nSomething like this could work\\nEveryone knows Earth is hollow\\nI am not a dog. Here’s a pic of me: pic.twitter.com/HUy6YRyDnc\\nModel S will be raised to 162mph too\\nThank you. May you have good luck and godspeed with your spacecraft!\\nThank you on behalf of SpaceX.

This basically splits the difference — about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction.

Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot & fast, so dicey.\\nAnnoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can’t. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that’s very rare.\\nYeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year’s vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer & max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying.\\nProbably no fairing either & just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what’s there. Not impossible.\\nRetrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it’s slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2.\\nAnyone who bought FSD will get it\n",

       "1315  2019-03-07  Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays & updated software with battery warmup results in >2X improvement in fleet charge time\\nWe will spend 3 or 6 months with public beta of V3 in North America, make sure there are no corner case issues & then begin buildout worldwide.\\nThose improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case & more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput.\\nLatest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to 25% for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original 2012 Model S. Not splitting power across 2 Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to 50%. https:// twitter.com/Alandbru/statu s/1103760956830691328 …\\nSo true\\nExtremely important merch pic.twitter.com/3ZUin7kzYk\\nNet power to warm pack is especially low when motors are running, as coolant loop routes motor heat to the pack when outside is cold (& rejects motor heat to air when outside is warm)\\nYes, but an engine shouldn’t count until it flies\\nUkraine did play a major role\\nVery little power & only right before you get to the Supercharger. You won’t notice it in range.\\nIf you navigate to Supercharger, car will warm up battery en route, so you start immediately at max power\\nRussia has excellent rocket engineering & best engine currently flying. Reusable version of their new Angara rocket would be great. https:// arstechnica.com/science/2019/0 3/with-dragon-russian-critic-says-roscosmos-acting-left-behind/ …\\nThanks, that sounds great!\\nYou’re most welcome.

Switched to chutes as primary, due to difficulty of proving safety, but Dragon can still do it. https:// m.youtube.com/watch?v=07Pm8Z Y0XJI …\\npic.twitter.com/JoBxDo3zwh                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            10278     108750                                                                                                https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1104517220313382912 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1104514410935050240 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1104511205933146112 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1104510803313487872 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1104510381886603264 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1104510016948592641 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1104509345922838528 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1104498091305009152                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Was done so because some simply couldn’t afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday.\\nHowever, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak\\nWe are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference — about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction.

Prices rise slightly worldwide on Tuesday. You can order online at http:// Tesla.com .\\nYes!\\nDefinitely down the road, once construction & upgrades aren’t so crazy\\nThis causes some media confusion, as batch builds & ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month & terrible following month, but consumer tastes don’t actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules.\\nNot exactly same time, as countries have different regulations & we try to build in batches to simplify production\\nMight arrive by June, but def before end of summer\\nModel 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that’s a lot of complexity.\\nExactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn’t critical for snowy regions.\\nStill get this question a lot, even though Norway has highest Tesla cars per person on (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice.\\nAbout a minute in, we flashed a teaser pic of Tesla cyberpunk truck pic.twitter.com/hLsGsdyuGA\\nEnd Titles from Blade Runner played after Model Y webcast cut https:// m.youtube.com/watch?v=JAwo7D PUFUM …\\nDesigned to feel much bigger on inside than it looks on outside.

       "1324  2019-03-17  Yes, full duration\\nWhite-hot parts reached orbital entry temp of around 1650 Kelvin\\nFalcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium & carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint.\\nTranspiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing. Zero refurbishment.\\nNo straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps\\nTesting Starship heatshield hex tiles pic.twitter.com/PycE9VthxQ\\nHexagonal tiles on most of windward side, no shield needed on leeward side, transpiration cooling on hotspots\\nOnly some of the hottest sections\\nFull size\\nWe decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don’t need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.\\nYou can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump & combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.\\nWorking on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship & Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations.\\nAgreed\\nRaptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We’re simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.\\nStarted rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout …\\nHopefully.

This will bring them in line.\\nTo be precise, midnight on April 1, so effective April 2\\nPlease note prices on all Tesla inventory cars worldwide rise by ~3% on April 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 2794      70334                                                                                                 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1109906133567725568 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1109901209446416385 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1109900605961596928 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1109900063302508545 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1109895691587862528 https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1109895343452282880                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Major improvement over Dragon 1.\\nMassive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow.\\nWe should send probes to outer solar system & get high res, true color images of these strange things. Maybe there’s an alien artifact out there …\\nSuper cool!\\nGood point\\nTax authorities tend to interpret things in their favor, but it sure sounds like you could be right!

Really looking fwd to getting Semi into production.\\nTesla Semi delivering Tesla cars pic.twitter.com/ttEpcW5d8G\\nPre-Happy birthday!\\nAmazing work by Tesla Delivery teams, especially in Europe & China! Most insane logistics challenge I’ve ever seen. Thanks also to many country & city officials for your help this weekend! Super appreciated.\\nComing soon!\\nNo\\nWow\\nhttp:// X.com/x\\nThis might be my finest work\\nDuck emoji defeats Emo G Records. Crushing victory.\\nI’m disappointed that my record label failed\\nEmo G Records https:// soundcloud.com/user-209448905 pic.twitter.com/anVkKeFMGr\\nInstagram comments are coding in emojis\\nAlso true\\nTrue\\nThe quality of emojis varies wildly\\nLame\\nC++ syntax sucks\\nAssert (“Money” == Series of heterogeneous databases insecurely connected with high latency. Primary purpose == Information system for allocation of human time. As automation++, value of money--);\\nEven connectivity at my house in Silicon Valley sucks!\\nLike the movie Us. Scary … but also empathetic.\\nNo, but for sure the other way around!\\nAlso the intense low frequency vibrations that you can’t hear, but you can feel in your chest\\nWe’re going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot & fast, so dicey.\\nAnnoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can’t. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that’s very rare.\\nYeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year’s vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer & max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying.\\nProbably no fairing either & just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what’s there. Not impossible.\\nRetrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable.
